# 🧠 Brain Tumor MRI Image Classification

A **Streamlit web application** that classifies **brain MRI images** into different tumor types using a **deep learning model** trained on medical imaging data.  
The goal of this project is to assist in **early tumor detection** through AI-powered image analysis.

## 💡 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how **deep learning** can be applied in healthcare diagnostics.  
By uploading a brain MRI image, the model predicts which tumor category the image belongs to.

### 🔍 Tumor Categories:
- 🧬 Glioma  
- 🧠 Meningioma  
- 🩺 Pituitary  
- ✅ No Tumor

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

| Category | Tools Used |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Programming Language** | Python 🐍 |
| **Frameworks** | TensorFlow, Streamlit |
| **Libraries** | NumPy, Pillow (PIL), Pickle |
| **Model Type** | MobileNetV2 (Pretrained CNN) |
| **Interface** | Streamlit Web App |

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Upload** a brain MRI image (JPG/PNG).  
2. The image is **preprocessed** (resized to 224×224 and normalized).  
3. The trained **MobileNetV2** deep learning model **predicts** the tumor type.  
4. The app displays:
   - Predicted tumor category  
   - Confidence score  
   - Bar chart of class probabilities
